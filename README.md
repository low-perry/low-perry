-⚡ Fun fact: In Albanian, a female dog and a certain insect that eats potatoes share a name. My grandma used to say,
> “The mother becomes a ‘bushtër’ for her children”.
> (Original) "Nëna për fëmijët bëhet bushtër".

Meaning that a mother can be as ferocious as a mother dog to protect her offspring and confusing me for a big chunk of
my childhood because I never understood why a mother would become a potato insect.
